Layla confronts her parents about their decision to reveal their Muslim heritage during an election when Islamophobia was prominent. They had chosen to tell the truth out of loyalty to American ideals but now face growing backlash from their community due to attacks on mosques, hate incidents, and political rhetoric inciting violence against Muslims. Despite their commitment to honesty, Layla feels their efforts are being overshadowed by fear mongering and increasingly radical rhetoric. Her dad maintains that telling the truth is a moral obligation, referencing his poetic views on truth. Meanwhile, Layla leaves for food, noting how her parents' hopeful stance during primary debates contrasts with the current chaos they face.
